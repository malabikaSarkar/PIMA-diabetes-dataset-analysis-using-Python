### PIMA(diabetes) dataset analysis using Python
PIMA dataset is basically Indian diabetes dataset which can be downloaded from Kaggle. The goal of the project is to compare various ML algorithms to predict if a patient has diabetes or not based on various diagnostic factors.
Here I am using Python 3.9.2 and scikit-learn 0.24.2 to implement the model.
**The following algorithms are used in this projects:**
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Naive Bayes**
4. **Support Vector Machine**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors**
6. **Random Forest**
7. **XGBOOST**

**SMOTE has been used for balancing and StandardScaler method for scaling the dataset. Here ROC_AUC is used for performance measurement.**
